		<h1>Veri Labs</h1>
		<span class="highlight">Veri Labs is specialised on web3 native compliance services.</span>

		<br> 
		<p><b>Our first project, <a href="https://kycdao.xyz">kycDAO</a></b>, to make trust a composable building block for the decentralized infrastructure stack</p>
		<p><b>Our second project, <a href="https://veriwrap.xyz/">Veri</a></b>, compliant DeFi through asset level compliance </p> <br> <br>

		<p><b>Background: </b></p>
		<p class="long-paragraph">The crypto markets enabled innovation at an unprecedented pace, increasingly blurring the line between web2 and web3; regulation of the markets is intensifying; and the quest to establish trust is foundational. Crypto, tokens, NFTs (non-fungible tokens), DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) are part of the consciousness, yet to many mainstream communities, “crypto” has a tarnished reputation. Scams, rug-pulls, and hacks seriously deteriorated trust in "crypto". Confusion over what it means to be “CeFi” or “DeFi” and educational gaps have, hindered the real scale of adoption and growth.
			<br> <span class="highlight">The next cycle in crypto will center around trust.</span> 

			Web3 has matured along with its recognition from a niche sub-culture to pop culture-level fame and from obscure forum entries to the desks of regulators and institutional investors. Contrary to the early days of blockchains, solving for trust is imperative can be a competitive advantage. The untapped opportunity of trust will be at the forefront of the next cycle and beyond for mature, thoughtful leaders in the web3 space, building for a better tomorrow.

			The opportunities are limitless when we solve pseudonymous trust and bridge the real and the metaverse.</p>
